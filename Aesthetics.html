        <p>Aesthetics<br>
<br>
<br>
A lamp glows down on my golden-brown tea<br>
It makes the surface shimmer<br>
A deep sweet sip and then it rests on the wooden table <br>
Next to my fluffy orange bed<br>
<br>
<br>
The salty cool breeze hushes my fears<br>
My ice cubes chime in the glass<br>
I raise it up to the sun and grin at the sea<br>
And stretch out in my driftwood chair<br>
<br>
<br>
The rain writes a rhythm on the roof of the shop<br>
My rich-tasting brew makes me sigh<br>
The quiet murmurs drone to let me know Iâ€™m not alone<br>
I glance outside and then rest with relief<br>
<br>
<br>
The sun is setting on the patient pickup truck<br>
My straw tastes my last sip of milkshake<br>
My friends sleep content at the day we have spent<br>
I peacefully watch the streetlights glide by</p>
