        <h2>The Parauditte</h2>
        <p>The Parauditte<br>
<br>
<br>
The giant, ancient, Forest Rulers<br>
Put on new robes with glee<br>
And paraded down the golden shore <br>
To the Monarchs of the Sea<br>
<br>
<br>
A white-crested wave<br>
A blossoming smile<br>
<br>
<br>
They sat down to talk for a little while<br>
<br>
<br>
The stars marched by <br>
As the sun grew old<br>
<br>
<br>
Many a tale and story were told<br>
Until the sea was shimmery gold<br>
<br>
<br>
Time to go<br>
Good-bye<br>
Good-bye<br>
<br>
<br>
Weâ€™ll see you again when Summer is nigh</p>
