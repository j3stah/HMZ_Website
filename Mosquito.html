        <h2>Mosquito</h2>
        <p>Mosquito<br>
<br>
<br>
You seemed quite shocked when you saw me<br>
I can only assume you’re a fan<br>
I’ve quite a lot of admirers you know<br>
More than you’d think one can<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess I’ll buzz around with you<br>
But be careful with that fist<br>
Wouldn’t want to cause an injury<br>
It’s a good thing that you missed<br>
<br>
<br>
You seem quite pleased at my company<br>
I have that effect on folks<br>
I like to bring a little cheer<br>
Maybe some talking and jokes<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I’ll give you an autograph<br>
You come across as very zealous<br>
There, done! Sorry if it itches<br>
Don’t tell the others or they’ll be jealous</p>
