        <h2>Giants</h2>
        <p>Giants<br>
<br>
<br>
The friendly giants brush the sky<br>
But I am caged by the grass<br>
Their altitude is calling me<br>
I wish this gap would pass<br>
<br>
<br>
They stride on through the kingdoms<br>
Racing to something new<br>
I am determined to get stronger<br>
I will soon be like them too<br>
<br>
<br>
One day I will be squashed no more<br>
One day Iâ€™ll bask in the stars<br>
With my ambition in my belt<br>
I will one day thunder to Mars<br>
<br>
<br>
They may have a start on me<br>
They may be a mountain ahead<br>
But I am fueled and I am training<br>
I will not sleep in where they tread</p>
