<h2>The Corruptor</h2>
<br/>
His colored glasses shine as he grins with hate<br/>
Their rules forbid him from reasoning with them<br/>
Nobody in charge makes the rules, the ones who do are far<br/>
Too far it’s gone, it’s come| to this. He slowly revs the car<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The bloody sun makes the horizon quake with fear<br/>
The car a blistered, beat-up bullet goes diving up a hill<br/>
<br/>
His friends all want to use the system, the system takes too long<br/>
He wants to burn it all and start again, the limitations gone<br/>
They fear the chaos he fears the pass-age of time<br/>
They resolve to save a rotting tree, he runs away-from the grime</p>
