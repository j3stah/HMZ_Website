<h2>Mosquito</h2>
<br/>
You seemed quite shocked when you saw me<br/>
I can only assume you’re a fan<br/>
I’ve quite a lot of admirers you know<br/>
More than you’d think one can<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I’ll buzz around with you<br/>
But be careful with that fist<br/>
Wouldn’t want to cause an injury<br/>
It’s a good thing that you missed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You seem quite pleased at my company<br/>
I have that effect on folks<br/>
I like to bring a little cheer<br/>
Maybe some talking and jokes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I’ll give you an autograph<br/>
You come across as very zealous<br/>
There, done! Sorry if it itches<br/>
Don’t tell the others or they’ll be jealous</p>
