<h2>What was the plan</h2>
<br/>
The seagulls swoop around my head,<br/>
But I have long removed my dread<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The cliff is sharp: shards, spikes, and shells<br/>
But unseen above me, I hear the bells<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mouth filled with grit and my mind filled with hope<br/>
My arms reach up and continue to grope<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The bells are much louder and the seagulls are gone<br/>
And the strength of the end keeps pushing me on<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My last step is eager and sends crumbling rock<br/>
But I’m up at the top, and I’m sweating with shock<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I sit on the edge with my mind in a flurry<br/>
Soaring with hope but sinking with worry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was years ago, and sunny, and on this cliff, I heard the roar<br/>
I’d been chased here by some shadows that I hadn’t seen before<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And my young face grinned, eyes sparkling with dare<br/>
My stance faced towards the shadows stood there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made lots of plans made on beautiful dreams<br/>
I knew what to do,  my head full of schemes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I turned and sprung off in a big leap of faith<br/>
I knew twould be hard, but I’d fooled every wraith<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But now on this gray morning, I wonder<br/>
If my plans were just a big, gaping blunder<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What had I wanted? What was the life I’d leapt off for?<br/>
What was the plan? Where’s the half-finished author?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I’d put myself through the cost, but what was the object?<br/>
Did I even still want what I’d held as a prospect? </p>
