<h2>The King</h2>
<br/>
The scraping from a league away<br/>
makes the flagstones curl and pray<br/>
the vines all shiver<br/>
the leaves all wither<br/>
and into the earth<br/>
the bugs all slither<br/>
The rusty scrape and labored drag<br/>
is a filty pot and a metal rag<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And finally with one last ring<br/>
into the valley limps the King<br/>
Golden horns drag on the ground<br/>
hence, causing the awful sound<br/>
He is a man, he is a beast<br/>
but his ribs are starved from any feast<br/>
the coin mail clinks against his bones<br/>
His greedy hunger gripes and groans<br/>
Not fat nor complacent is he<br/>
His jeweled fangs lash out in agony</p>
