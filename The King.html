        <h2>The King</h2>
        <p>The King<br>
<br>
<br>
The scraping from a league away<br>
makes the flagstones curl and pray<br>
the vines all shiver<br>
the leaves all wither<br>
and into the earth<br>
the bugs all slither<br>
The rusty scrape and labored drag<br>
is a filty pot and a metal rag<br>
<br>
<br>
And finally with one last ring<br>
into the valley limps the King<br>
Golden horns drag on the ground<br>
hence, causing the awful sound<br>
He is a man, he is a beast<br>
but his ribs are starved from any feast<br>
the coin mail clinks against his bones<br>
His greedy hunger gripes and groans<br>
Not fat nor complacent is he<br>
His jeweled fangs lash out in agony</p>
