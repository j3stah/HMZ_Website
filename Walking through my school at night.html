        <h2>Walking through my school at night</h2>
        <p>Walking through my school at night<br>
<br>
<br>
Walking through my school at night<br>
Face resigned as the lamps glow bright<br>
The halls are dark and the classrooms sealed<br>
At this my sense of ease revealed<br>
<br>
<br>
I cannot be harmed for now,<br>
That, the locked doors will not allow<br>
I no longer mill around with dread<br>
The thought of failure leaves my head<br>
<br>
<br>
But there are figures in the halls<br>
I see their shadows on the walls<br>
Their backs are bent, bent from more<br>
Than anything their packs could store</p>
