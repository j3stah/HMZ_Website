<h2>Walking through my school at night</h2>
<p>Walking through my school at night<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Walking through my school at night<br/>
Face resigned as the lamps glow bright<br/>
The halls are dark and the classrooms sealed<br/>
At this my sense of ease revealed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot be harmed for now,<br/>
That, the locked doors will not allow<br/>
I no longer mill around with dread<br/>
The thought of failure leaves my head<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But there are figures in the halls<br/>
I see their shadows on the walls<br/>
Their backs are bent, bent from more<br/>
Than anything their packs could store</p>
