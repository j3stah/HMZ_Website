        <h2>Fire</h2>
        <p>Fire<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm grasping onto life<br>
rasping the smoke is<br>
clasping at my throat<br>
relapsing into flames<br>
this world needs a distinguisher<br>
you're fuel or an extinguisher<br>
in this burning, churning,<br>
this learning aggressively<br>
impressively yet repressively<br>
especially<br>
when it's divided it gets polar<br>
but we're sweating like it's solar<br>
grind your molars<br>
and crunch them like some boulders<br>
burn them til they smolder<br>
cherry-pick your folders<br>
see what makes them switch<br>
They make me twitch <br>
just like a candle<br>
set fire to a scandal<br>
And they go flying off the handle</p>
