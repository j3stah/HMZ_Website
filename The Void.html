        <h2>The Void</h2>
        <p>The Void<br>
<br>
<br>
The void is neat and ordered<br>
It's bordered<br>
by impossible contours<br>
Blank stares turn to statues<br>
concentric eyes cannot track you<br>
Nothing is a trinket<br>
So I pour the essence of nothing<br>
into a glass and drink it<br>
Gray air morphs into<br>
Gray stares<br>
My head is dizzy and aching<br>
Throw up static, painstaking<br>
My 1's turn to 0's<br>
That line up in neat rows <br>
of nothing, while<br>
the ghost of a shell peers out at you<br>
But glazed eyes cannot track you<br>
from inside of a vacuum where<br>
Rigid black gridlines<br>
turn into landmines<br>
You never looked at the system<br>
to see if it fits him<br>
You take his words and turn them<br>
into Lorem Ipsum<br>
The pathways all curve but go to the same place<br>
The wind curves and it erodes at my face.</p>
