<h2>The Grand Canyon</h2>
<p>The Grand Canyon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A mist veiled a great many things <br/>
The next day it revealed without abandon<br/>
Oh if only Iâ€™d had wings!<br/>
To glide into that canyon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great fields of stone<br/>
Silent in their voices <br/>
In my heart they struck a tone<br/>
By their presence they made noises!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many swaying little bushes<br/>
Like explorers climbing the sides<br/>
While the coiling river rushes<br/>
Sculpting masterpiece with its tides<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The molds of castles one could view<br/>
But poured over with molten sunset<br/>
Deep red, Soft pink, Pure orange too<br/>
amber, bronze, yes, and russet <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sturdy towers of stone soaring<br/>
A myriad of ravines plunging<br/>
The strong river faintly roaring<br/>
Across the landscape, the sun was lunging<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sanded and stony layers there were<br/>
Like wrinkles on a face<br/>
Everything a silencer<br/>
An awe-inspiring Place<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe given time, given time it may<br/>
With different rivers, colors, rocks, weathers<br/>
The earth might look this way</p>
