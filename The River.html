        <h2>The River</h2>
        <p>The River<br>
<br>
Strong and true <br>
With color blue<br>
The River rushes by.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gurgling and Splashing<br>
Twisting and Lashing<br>
as it winks up at the Sky<br>
<br>
<br>
Wild and Free<br>
itâ€™s plain to see<br>
it goes on and on <br>
and on<br>
<br>
<br>
From where it begins <br>
to where it goes. <br>
No-one yet <br>
truly knows<br>
<br>
<br>
As it shimmers and shines <br>
quite gracefully<br>
Like Diamonds scattered carefully<br>
<br>
<br>
Cool and wet it invites you yet<br>
with a rippling embrace<br>
<br>
<br>
And all the while it goes on and on <br>
at the same old steady pace<br>
<br>
<br>
The Currents dance<br>
The fish do prance<br>
As they enjoy the water life</p>
